## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

-   used typescript because it boosts efficiency of organized fetched data and debugging.
-   used scss to make css neater.
-   used reducers for putting data in one centralized place. This makes it easier to look at the entire state of the application.
-   splitted components into smaller components: card, details,news for rendering props.
-   since news may be updated anytime, it would fetch all news when users click the News button.

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

-   reorganize css files: use mixin and decrease duplicated code.
-   use HOC to create reuse components if they are in the similar format.
-   add a pagenation for a better UX.

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

-   would optimise UI/UX according to more reference
-   would add some animation such as Slider/Carousel/Swipe for photos or cards to increase user experience.
-   would decrease duplicated parts of css and components.
-   would implement unit tests.
-   would embed google map for location deplaying, which is just a link to open google map.
-   for fetching latest news, may be there is a way to update few of them instead of refreshing all news data.
-   would design a better page for informing catch error.
